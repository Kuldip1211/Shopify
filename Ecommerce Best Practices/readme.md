Increase your sales by improving user experience and buyer flow.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Boost organic traffic through proper markup and fast performance.

- Add unique meta titles and descriptions  
- Use semantic HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`  
- Include alt attributes on all images  
- Add JSON-LD product schema  
- Optimize images using Shopify‚Äôs CDN  

```liquid
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "{{ product.title }}",
  "image": "{{ product.featured_image | img_url: 'large' }}",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "{{ product.price | money_without_currency }}"
  }
}
</script>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ User Experience (UX) Design Principles

#### ‚ôø Key Guidelines

‚úÖ **This version:**
- Uses proper Markdown formatting (works perfectly on GitHub)
